## <a id="description"></a>Description 

This project was designed to simulate an IDE within a PWA. The starter code was already provided, so the goal of the project was to refactor an existing application into an installable and offline-ready application.

## <a id="install"></a>Installation 

To run this project locally, navigate to the root directory within your preferred CLI. Run `npm i` to install the over-arching dependencies, then run `npm run install` to acquire the needed dependencies for both the client and server-side sub-applications. Alternatively, you may `cd` into each application and run `npm i` within all three, respectively.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage Instructions 

To start the program locally, navigate to the root directory and run `npm run start:dev`. This will run the server, and then build out the client using webpack. Once your CLI indicates that the service worker is functioning and caching static assets, you can pull up `localhost:3000` in the browser. From there, simply type as much as you please and the data will persist on page reload. To install the application outside of the browser, you can press the install button on the top of the screen, or press the install button in your browser window.
